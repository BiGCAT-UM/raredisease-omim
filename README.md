# Rare Disease - OMIM

This repository contains R and Groovy scripts to convert TSV data linking rare diseases to OMIM information,
collected by Friederike Ehrhart in a Google spreadsheet, to semantic web formats.

The `rdf` folder has R scripts to create RDF, while the `nanopub` folder creates nanopublication.
